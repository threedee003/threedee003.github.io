I focus on using deep learning, reinforcement learning methods and control systems engineering to develop elegant solutions for robot arm manipulators in TCS Research and Innovation Labs in Bangalore. 

Before joining TCS Research I had the oppurtunity to work under the guidance of Dr. [Sheli Sinha Chaudhuri](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=geloMhgAAAAJ&hl=en) and Dr. [Nilanjan Dey](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=uZmrRHAAAAAJ&hl=en) in medical image analysis using deep learning methods, while completing my B.E.E at  [Jadavpur University](https://jadavpuruniversity.in/), India.

You can reach out to me via mail or LinkedIn to talk about my work or collaborate or for any questions you would like to ask.
