I focus on using generative modeling and deep reinforcement learning for robotic motion policies to achieve autonomous control in robot arm manipulators. I work with explicit, implicit, diffusion and reinforcement learning policies to create elegant control solutions for robot arm manipulators at TCS Research and Innovation Labs in Bangalore. 

I received my B.E (Bachelor of Engineering) in Electrical Engineering from [Jadavpur University](https://jadavpuruniversity.in/) in Kolkata, India in 2023. Previously I had the privilege to work and learn medical image analysis using deep learning techniques from professors [Sheli Sinha Chaudhuri](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=geloMhgAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Nilanjan Dey](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=uZmrRHAAAAAJ&hl=en). 

You may reach out to me via mail or LinkedIn to talk about my work or collaborate.
