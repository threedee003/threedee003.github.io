Hello, I am Tribikram. I graduated in Electrical Engineering (B.E) from Jadavpur University, India.

I currently work as a researcher in TCS Research and Innovation Labs in
Smart Machines and Autonomous Infrastructure in Bangalore, India. I work on robotics and reinforcement learning.
Previously I have worked in deep learning applications in Biomedical Imaging. 


This is my space where I showcase my work and passion. Feel free to go through my blogs and reach me out if you
