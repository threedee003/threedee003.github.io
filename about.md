I focus on using generative modeling for robotic motion policies to achieve autonomous control across different types of dynamical systems. I work with explicit, implicit, and diffusion models to create control solutions for robot arm manipulators at TCS Research and Innovation Labs in Bangalore. 



I graduated with a Bachelor's degree (B.E) in Electrical Engineering from Jadavpur University in Kolkata, India.


This page is where I share my latest personal projects and interests in robotics and deep learning.
