Visuomotor Policy has been a widely researched topic in the last few years and have captured the research attention of many roboticists and deep learning practitioners. Imitation Learning can be boradly classified into two parts : 
<ol>
<li>Behaviour Cloning.</li>
<li>Inverse Optimal Control</li>
</ol>

This blog contains a brief overview of behaviour cloning using different policy based methods. Presently the SOTA practices mainly three types of robot visuomotor policies they can be categorized on the way the problem formulation has been done for them. 
<ol>
<li>Explicit Policy</li>
<li>Implicit Policy</li>
<li>Diffusion Policy[^1]</li>
